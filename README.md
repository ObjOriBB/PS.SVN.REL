Powershell subversion for release management

## Purpose (170826)
Companies who are new to the concepts/disciplines of **Agile, Continous Integration, Jira (or workflows), use of SVN and Git** can use this project to spring board their **Dev/Release/Deploy** teams.

This project can be useful if the organization is coming from **Windows servers** and would like to migrate to **Linux flavored servers**. Your **Dev/Release/Deploy** teams can benefit by learning **Powershell** as it has simple **Linux** commands.  

The goal is to learn the basics of **Linux flavored** terminal commands thru **Powershell** while doing **SVN** (if SVN is the preferred version control tool of the company).

Much of the codes (and ideas) are based from [**rchaganti/PSBookmark**](https://github.com/rchaganti/PSBookmark) and [**fpschultze/PsSubversion**](https://github.com/fpschultze/PsSubversion).

Actual codes will be uploaded soon.
